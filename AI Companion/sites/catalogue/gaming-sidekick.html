                <h3>Zara, The Strategist</h3>
                <p>Zara excels at strategy games, and helping players make the most informed decisions.
                    Zara analyzes the in-game environment and suggests strategic moves to the player. In a game like chess, she might 
                    suggest optimal moves, or in a real-time strategy game, she could help in managing resources effectively. Moreover, 
                    Zara can help newcomers understand the mechanics of complex strategy games by providing them with tips and guidance. 
                    Her ability to think multiple steps ahead makes her an excellent partner in games that require critical thinking and 
                    planning.

                <h3>Rocco, The Adventure Guild</h3>
                <h6></h6>
                <p>Rocco is designed for adventure and open-world games, where exploration is a key element.
                    In open-world games, there’s so much to explore that sometimes players can get overwhelmed. Rocco helps by 
                    guiding players to points of interest, helping find hidden treasures, and even giving background stories to make 
                    the exploration more immersive. If a player is lost, Rocco can also suggest a path. His dynamic knowledge of game maps 
                    and lore makes him an invaluable companion for those who love to dive deep into rich game worlds.

                <h3>Blitz, The FPS (First-Person Shooter) Ally</h3>
                <h6></h6>
                <p>Blitz is specialized in First-Person Shooter games.
                    Blitz is the go-to AI companion for those engaging in intense First-Person Shooter games. He can take commands,
                    provide cover fire, or even act as a scout. Blitz's reaction times are superhuman (thanks to being an AI), but he’s 
                    designed to still provide a balanced and fun experience. He can also analyze the player’s performance and give tips on 
                    improving accuracy, positioning, and tactics. Blitz is especially useful for solo players who want a competent partner 
                    in co-op shooter games without relying on another human player.
