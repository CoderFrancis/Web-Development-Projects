        <h2>Upper Body Enhancements</h2>
        <p>Discover our range of cutting-edge upper body enhancements designed to provide superior strength, agility, and aesthetics.</p>
        
        <!-- You can use the following block for each enhancement -->

            <h3>1. Neural Interface 2. Exoskeletal Frame  3. Muscular Augmentation 4. Chest and Abdominal Panel 5. Cardiovascular Enhancer
                6. Energy Distribution System</h3>
            <p>Short description of the enhancement and its benefits.
                The subject’s skin, retaining its natural hue, is juxtaposed against the polished metallic sheen of the enhancements. 
                The meticulous integration ensures that augmentation accentuates rather than overshadows human elements.

                The subject’s gaze, intense and focused, alludes to the enhanced cognitive capabilities endowed by neural enhancements. 
                Processing speed, memory retention, sensory perception – all significantly amplified.

                The chest and shoulders, where biology meets technology, exemplify this harmonious integration. Artificial musculature, 
                encased in a protective alloy, flows seamlessly into the natural skin, illustrating the symbiosis of man and machine.

            <h3>1. Material Composition 2. Aerodynamic Design 3. Neural Interface</h3>
            <p>Short description of the enhancement and its benefits.
            A. Helmet and Visual Interface:

            The helmet, a masterpiece of engineering, offers enhanced visual acuity and sensory perception. The golden visor integrates 
            advanced optics, enabling multi-spectral vision and real-time data overlay.
            B. Shoulder and Arm Enhancements:

            The upper body, adorned with streamlined armor, is designed for maximal mobility and strength. The golden linings are not just 
            aesthetic but are functional elements serving as conduits for power distribution and system monitoring.

            A. Central Core:

            Embedded within the chest is the central core, a powerhouse that fuels and coordinates all cybernetic functions.

            B. Kinetic Energy Absorbers:

            Embedded within the armor are advanced kinetic absorbers, dispersing impact and ensuring the wearer’s safety.

            C. Climate Control System:

            Integrated systems modulate temperature, ensuring optimal performance under diverse environmental conditions.
